Developer tools for OpenDomo
============================

OpenDomo-devel provides useful development tools for [OpenDomo OS](http://es.opendomo.org). At this point, the project is in the conceptual phase, so the features are still very limited, but the objective is to fulfill the following features:

* **Debug information** visible from the CGI itself. 
* **Translation tools** to adapt the project for any language.
* **Package creator.** 

More features will be discussed in the [Issues section](https://github.com/opalenzuela/opendomo-devel/issues) of this project.

How to try it?
==============

First download and install the latest [OpenDomo OS 2 version] (http://es.opendomo.org/downloads), log into it as admin and type the following commands:

    $ managePlugins.sh
    $ installPlugin.sh oddevel

Note that it can also be installed from the Configuration menu in the web interface.

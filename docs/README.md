Creating a plugin
=================

The plugins provide complementary features for the OpenDomo system. Starting in the version 2.0, this concept has been separated from the more technical "package" term.

Steps
-----
* **Describe the project.** Make sure that the objectives of the project are not fulfilled in another project. We don't need 10 plugins to do the same! If you think that some other plugin is missing a feature, join the development team and help them to implement it!
* **Create a new project repository.** Start defining your objectives in a README file and tell us about your ideas. We will try to help you to create a developers team.
* **Define your milestones.** Be realistic: the first steps must be very easy, mostly conceptual, to overcome the first non-strategical obstacles (problems packging or deploying the plugin, for instance). One step after another.
* **Start the development** by creating the whole directory standard structure (docs, usr/local/opendomo, var/opendomo and mkpkg.sh)
